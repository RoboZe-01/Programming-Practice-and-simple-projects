ko✅ Phase 1: Fundamentals + Data Types & Control Flow (Days 1–10)
Goal: Build strong foundations in thinking with variables, lists, conditions, loops.

Topics:
Data Types: int, float, str, list, dict, tuple, set

Conditional logic: if-else, nested if, ternary operator

Loops: for, while, loop with break, continue, range()

Daily Plan:
30 min: Solve 3–5 basic problems (Ex: reverse a string, count vowels, check palindrome)

30 min: Create mini automations/scripts (Ex: text filter, age calculator, file renamer)

Tools:
Platform: HackerRank, CodingBat, Replit Challenges

Pro Tip:
👉 Always solve problems manually on paper first, then code. It strengthens logic intuition.

# 🚀 **Phase 1: Fundamentals + Data Types & Control Flow**

**📅 Days: 1–10 | ⏰ Time: 1 hour/day | 🎯 Goal: Build solid logic using core Python elements**

---

## 📘 **🗓️ Daily Breakdown with Tips & Problems**

---

### 🔹 **Day 1: Variables, Input/Output, Basic Operations**

**Concepts**: `print()`, `input()`, variables, arithmetic ops, f-strings
**Problems**:

* Add two numbers
* Swap two variables
* Calculate area of a circle
* Simple interest calculator
  **Tip**: *Use f-strings to format output cleanly*
  **Pro Tip**: Write same code using both `input()` and hardcoded values — improves flexibility

---

### 🔹 **Day 2: Data Types and Type Conversion**

**Concepts**: `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `bool()`, `type()`
**Problems**:

* Convert temperature (C to F)
* Check type of input and convert it
* Calculate BMI (input height/weight)
  **Tip**: *Use `type()` to debug input issues*
  **Pro Tip**: Make a “converter toolkit” script with 5 conversions (km to miles, INR to USD, etc.)

---

### 🔹 **Day 3: String Manipulation & Slicing**

**Concepts**: slicing, `len()`, `lower()`, `upper()`, `strip()`, `split()`, `join()`
**Problems**:

* Reverse a string
* Count vowels
* Check if a string is a palindrome
* Capitalize every word in a sentence
  **Tip**: *Slicing helps everywhere — in strings, lists, files, etc.*
  **Pro Tip**: Try the same logic with both loops and built-in functions

---

### 🔹 **Day 4: Conditionals (`if-else`)**

**Concepts**: basic conditionals, nested if, `elif`
**Problems**:

* Odd or even checker
* Largest of 3 numbers
* Grading system (90+: A, 80-89: B, etc.)
* Check leap year
  **Tip**: *Draw flowcharts to visualize nested if blocks*
  **Pro Tip**: Convert 2–3 of the above into CLI tools (grading, leap year, BMI)

---

### 🔹 **Day 5: Loops (`for`, `while`)**

**Concepts**: `for`, `while`, `range()`, loop counters
**Problems**:

* Print multiplication table
* Factorial of number
* Sum of first `n` numbers
* Count digits in a number
  **Tip**: *Use `range(start, stop, step)` to control flow*
  **Pro Tip**: Practice the same task using both `for` and `while`

---

### 🔹 **Day 6: Loop Control — `break`, `continue`, `else`**

**Concepts**: loop flow control
**Problems**:

* Prime number checker
* Find first multiple of 7 between 1–100
* Password prompt with 3 attempts
  **Tip**: *Use `else` in loops when item not found (like in search)*
  **Pro Tip**: Think of game logic — like guessing games using these patterns

---

### 🔹 **Day 7: Lists — Basics and Looping**

**Concepts**: indexing, `append()`, `pop()`, `len()`, list loops
**Problems**:

* Sum of elements in list
* Find max and min in a list
* Count even and odd numbers
* Reverse a list manually
  **Tip**: *Always initialize your list clearly — avoid undefined behavior*
  **Pro Tip**: Try solving list problems with both index loop (`for i in range`) and direct loop (`for item in list`)

---

### 🔹 **Day 8: List Comprehension + Advanced List Ops**

**Concepts**: `list comprehension`, `in`, `not in`, `sort()`, `reverse()`, slicing
**Problems**:

* Square of each number in list
* Extract even numbers from list
* Remove duplicates
* Flatten a 2D list (list of lists)
  **Tip**: *List comprehension = logic in a single line. Practice it!*
  **Pro Tip**: Refactor an old problem using list comprehension and compare speed & clarity

---

### 🔹 **Day 9: Dictionaries & Sets**

**Concepts**: `dict`, key-value access, `set`, uniqueness
**Problems**:

* Count word frequency
* Find duplicates using set
* Merge two dicts
* Create dictionary from two lists
  **Tip**: *Use sets for fast lookup and removing duplicates*
  **Pro Tip**: Build a CLI word counter script that reads a paragraph and prints word frequency

---

### 🔹 **Day 10: Practice Day — Combine Everything**

**Goal**: Apply everything you’ve learned in mini problems and combine concepts.

**Problems**:

* ATM simulation (check balance, withdraw, deposit)
* Quiz app (MCQs using dict + input + loops)
* Custom calculator using functions
* File renamer script using list + string methods
  **Tip**: *Combine conditionals + loops + functions for real problem solving*
  **Pro Tip**: Take an idea from your life and try to automate it using these tools.

---

## 🧠 **Mindset Tips to Build Problem Solving Habit**

1. **Don’t rush to code**:
   First write logic in plain English or draw it.

2. **After solving a problem, write what you learned**:
   → What data structure was used?
   → Could this be written more efficiently?

3. **Repeat hard problems** after 3 days — builds long-term logic memory.

4. **Focus on clarity over cleverness**:
   Write readable code, not fancy one-liners.
