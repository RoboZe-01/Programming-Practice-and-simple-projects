so i just want to practice my typing here , like just want to apply and thinking by typing in this folder .. 

So one of my goals was to increase my typing speed from 29 to 50 in 30 days . 
SO for that first I need to get used to my keyboard . like i must know where the keys are without directly looking to it .

okay lets work on that first i am practice this with like slow typing but feeling the keys bit better . 
Like feeling the keys in my fingers . and Let them know there place to be type . it's like mind muscle connection ..


Soo what i thought about today is that .. from last 4 to 5 days i have been so procrastinating the tasks that i should do . i was wasteing most of my time playing free fire . so today i finally uninstalled it .. So i will practice something daily . like type intentioly type fast as possible . to make it an habit of the daily life .. i need to do it .
