# In this problem we will find out area and circumfaremce of the circle with provided Radius 

# Thought process is very simple we just first make a input funcion which takes the radius input 
# then use print function to make the formula for area and  circumferance


# Make input funtion 

Radius = int(input(" Enter the radius : "))
area = print(f'The Area the circle with given Radius {Radius} is {3.14*Radius**2} ')

Circumferance = print(f'The circumferance of the circle with given Radius {Radius} is {2*3.14*Radius}')
