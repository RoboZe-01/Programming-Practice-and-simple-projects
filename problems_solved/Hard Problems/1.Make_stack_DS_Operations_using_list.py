# Stacks: Implement a stack data structure using a list in Python. 
# Include methods for push, pop, and peek operations.




# Basically we want to make a python program to make a functios to perform: 
# 1.Push  ( Add the objest to top )
# 2.pop   ( removes or return the top element)
# 3.Peek (Returns the top element without removing them )
# 4. isEmpty ( Check is list is empty or not )


class Stack :
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def push (self,item):
        return self.items.append(item)
    def pop (self,item):
